# Production Connection Status Guide

This guide explains how to verify that the frontend is properly connected to the Railway backend service in production.

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Connection Status Components Added to `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`:

1. **ConnectionBanner** - Shows at the top when connection fails
2. **ProductionConnectionDot** - Small indicator in the top-right corner
3. **EnvironmentBadge** - Shows current environment (DEV/PROD)
4. **ProductionConnectionIndicator** - Floating detailed status (top-left)
5. **ConnectionDebug** - Detailed debug information panel

### âœ… Global Connection Provider in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`:

- Wraps the entire app with `ConnectionProvider`
- Monitors connection every 30 seconds
- Provides global connection state

## How to Verify Connection Status

### In Development:

1. **Environment Badge**: Shows green "DEVELOPMENT"
2. **Connection Dot**: Shows connection to `http://localhost:3001`
3. **Debug Panel**: Shows detailed connection info
4. **Floating Indicator**: Shows development connection status

### In Production:

1. **Environment Badge**: Shows red "PRODUCTION"
2. **Connection Dot**: Shows "PROD" with connection status to Railway
3. **Debug Panel**: Shows Railway service details
4. **Floating Indicator**: Shows Railway connection status

## Visual Indicators

### Connection Status Colors:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Successfully connected to backend
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Disconnected from backend
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Checking connection (animated pulse)

### Environment Colors:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green Badge**: Development environment
- ðŸ”´ **Red Badge**: Production environment

## Railway Service Details

**Production API URL**: `https://faceapp-lhtz.onrender.com`

### Expected Behavior in Production:

1. Environment badge shows "PRODUCTION" in red
2. Connection dot shows "PROD"
3. Debug panel shows:
   - API URL: `https://faceapp-lhtz.onrender.com/api`
   - Environment: production
   - Backend info from Railway service
4. Floating indicator shows "Connected to Production API"

## Testing the Connection

### Manual Test:

1. Open the app in production
2. Look for the indicators in the top-right corner
3. Check the debug panel for detailed status
4. Verify the floating indicator shows Railway connection

### Programmatic Test:

Run the connection test script:

```bash
cd frontend
node test-connection.js
```

This will test both development and production endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Shows as Disconnected:

1. **Check Railway Service Status**:

   - Visit: `https://faceapp-lhtz.onrender.com/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","environment":"production"}`

2. **Check Network Issues**:

   - Open browser dev tools â†’ Network tab
   - Look for failed requests to Railway service
   - Check for CORS errors

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `NODE_ENV=production` is set
   - Check that build process sets production mode

### Indicators Not Showing:

1. **Verify Components Are Imported**:

   - Check `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` has all imports
   - Verify `ConnectionProvider` is in `layout.tsx`

2. **Check Console for Errors**:

   - Open browser dev tools â†’ Console
   - Look for React/TypeScript errors

3. **Verify Build Process**:
   - Ensure production build includes all components
   - Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Files Modified

### Core Files:

- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ConnectionProvider
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Added all connection indicators

### New Components:

- `frontend/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ProductionConnectionIndicator.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ConnectionDebug.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/EnvironmentBadge.tsx`

### New Hooks & Context:

- `frontend/src/hooks/useConnectionStatus.ts`
- `frontend/src/contexts/ConnectionContext.tsx`

### Configuration:

- `frontend/src/lib/api-config.ts`
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## Expected Production Behavior

When deployed to production with `NODE_ENV=production`:

1. **Top-right corner shows**:

   - Red "PRODUCTION" badge
   - Green dot with "PROD" (if connected)
   - Red dot with "PROD" (if disconnected)

2. **Top-left floating indicator shows**:

   - "Connected to Production API" (green)
   - "Disconnected from Production API" (red)
   - Railway service branding

3. **Debug panel shows**:

   - Environment: production
   - API URL: https://faceapp-lhtz.onrender.com/api
   - Backend environment info from Railway
   - Last checked timestamp

4. **Connection banner appears** if Railway service is unreachable

This provides clear visual confirmation that the frontend is properly connected to the Railway backend service in production.
