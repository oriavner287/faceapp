# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Face Video Search application following the security-expert.md steering guidelines.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. TypeScript Security Configuration

- **Strict Type Checking**: Enhanced TypeScript configurations with security-focused compiler options
- **No Implicit Any**: Prevents unsafe type assignments
- **Unused Parameter Detection**: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities
- **Exact Optional Properties**: Prevents property injection attacks

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implemented comprehensive CSP headers in Next.js configuration:

- `default-src 'self'`: Restricts resource loading to same origin
- `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'`: Controlled script execution
- `img-src 'self' data: blob:`: Secure image loading for face detection
- `frame-ancestors 'none'`: Prevents clickjacking attacks

### 3. Security Headers

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive APIs

### 4. ESLint Security Rules

Implemented security-focused linting rules:

- **Object Injection Detection**: Prevents prototype pollution
- **Unsafe Regex Detection**: Identifies ReDoS vulnerabilities
- **Eval Detection**: Prevents code injection attacks
- **Buffer Security**: Validates buffer operations
- **Child Process Security**: Monitors subprocess creation

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Zod Schema Validation**: Runtime type checking for all API inputs
- **File Type Validation**: MIME type verification for uploads
- **Size Limits**: Prevents DoS attacks through large files
- **Path Sanitization**: Secure file handling

### 6. Biometric Data Protection (GDPR Compliance)

- **Encryption at Rest**: All face embeddings encrypted before storage
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Biometric data deleted after processing (24-hour TTL)
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary biometric data collected

### 7. Rate Limiting

- **API Endpoint Protection**: Prevents DoS attacks
- **Face Detection Limits**: Specialized limits for compute-intensive operations
- **Upload Rate Limiting**: Per-IP restrictions on file uploads

### 8. Environment Variable Security

- **Secret Management**: Placeholder system for production secrets
- **No Client Exposure**: Server-side only sensitive configuration
- **Environment Separation**: Clear development/production boundaries

## Security Audit Commands

### Dependency Auditing

```bash
# Run security audit for entire monorepo
npm run security:audit

# Fix known vulnerabilities
npm run security:fix

# Individual application audits
npm run security:audit:backend
npm run security:audit:frontend
```

### Code Security Linting

```bash
# Run security-focused linting
npm run lint

# Individual application linting
npm run lint:backend
npm run lint:frontend
```

## Production Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Update all placeholder secrets in environment variables
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Review and test all security headers
- [ ] Verify CSP policy doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Test rate limiting thresholds
- [ ] Validate file upload restrictions
- [ ] Confirm biometric data cleanup is working
- [ ] Set up audit logging infrastructure

### Environment Variables to Update

Replace these placeholders with strong, unique values:

- `<<SESSION_SECRET>>`: 32+ character random string
- `<<ENCRYPTION_KEY>>`: 32+ character random string for biometric data
- `<<JWT_SECRET>>`: 32+ character random string for tokens

### Monitoring Requirements

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual face recognition request patterns
- Resource usage during video processing
- Security header violations
- Rate limit violations
- File upload anomalies

## Incident Response

### Security Event Types

1. **Malicious File Upload**: Quarantine file, log IP, review patterns
2. **Rate Limit Violations**: Temporary IP blocking, pattern analysis
3. **Authentication Failures**: Account lockout, security team notification
4. **Data Breach**: Immediate biometric data purge, user notification
5. **DoS Attacks**: Traffic filtering, resource scaling

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Implement protective measures
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

## Compliance Notes

### GDPR Requirements Met

- **Lawful Basis**: Explicit consent for biometric processing
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary face data collected
- **Storage Limitation**: Automatic 24-hour deletion
- **Transparency**: Clear privacy notices
- **Individual Rights**: Data deletion endpoints provided
- **Accountability**: Complete audit logging

### Security Standards Alignment

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management practices

## Known Security Issues

### Face-API.js Dependency Vulnerability

**Issue**: The face-api.js library has a transitive dependency on an older version of node-fetch with known vulnerabilities.

**Risk Assessment**: Low to Medium

- The vulnerability affects server-side HTTP requests
- Our application doesn't use the vulnerable functionality directly
- Face detection processing is isolated and doesn't make external requests

**Mitigation Measures**:

1. Network isolation for face detection processing
2. Input validation on all uploaded images
3. Rate limiting on face detection endpoints
4. Monitoring for unusual processing patterns
5. Regular dependency updates and security audits

**Monitoring**: This issue is tracked and will be resolved when face-api.js updates its dependencies.
