# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload a photo of a person's face and search for similar-looking individuals in videos from predefined websites. The application will analyze the uploaded image using face recognition technology, extract facial features, and compare them against faces detected in video thumbnails from hard-coded website URLs. Users will receive a list of matching videos with similarity confidence scores and direct links to the content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a photo containing a person's face, so that I can search for videos featuring similar-looking individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display an image upload component with a clear "Upload Image" button
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
3. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the uploaded image
4. IF the uploaded image exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
5. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL enable the search functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze my uploaded photo and detect facial features, so that accurate face matching can be performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL detect faces in the image using face recognition technology
2. IF no faces are detected in the uploaded image THEN the system SHALL display an error message "No face detected in the uploaded image"
3. IF multiple faces are detected THEN the system SHALL use the largest/most prominent face for matching
4. WHEN a face is detected THEN the system SHALL generate facial feature embeddings for comparison
5. WHEN face processing is complete THEN the system SHALL initiate the video search process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to search predefined websites for videos, so that I can find content featuring similar-looking individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN face embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL fetch video data from exactly three hard-coded URLs: https://example.com/site1, https://example.com/site2, https://example.com/site3
2. WHEN fetching from each website THEN the system SHALL limit the search to a maximum of 10 videos per site
3. WHEN video data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL extract or download video thumbnails for face analysis
4. IF a website is unreachable or returns errors THEN the system SHALL continue processing other websites and log the error
5. WHEN thumbnail extraction fails for a video THEN the system SHALL skip that video and continue with others

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to perform face detection on video thumbnails and compare them with my uploaded photo, so that I can find matching individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video thumbnails are obtained THEN the system SHALL perform face detection on each thumbnail
2. WHEN faces are detected in thumbnails THEN the system SHALL generate facial feature embeddings for each detected face
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL compute similarity scores between the user's face and detected faces
4. WHEN similarity scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL filter results using an adjustable similarity threshold (default 0.7)
5. IF no faces meet the similarity threshold THEN the system SHALL display "No similar person found" message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view search results with video information and similarity scores, so that I can evaluate and access relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN matching videos are found THEN the system SHALL display results in a responsive grid layout
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show video thumbnails, titles, similarity confidence levels, and direct links for each match
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL sort them by similarity score in descending order
4. WHEN a user clicks on a video link THEN the system SHALL open the video in a new tab/window
5. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display a clear "No similar person found" message with suggestions to try a different image

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my privacy protected during the face matching process, so that my personal data remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it temporarily only for the duration of the matching process
2. WHEN the matching process is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the uploaded image and generated embeddings
3. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL not persist any facial embeddings or image data to permanent storage
4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL still ensure cleanup of temporary user data
5. WHEN a user starts a new search THEN the system SHALL clear all previous session data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry options
2. WHEN face detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about the issue (e.g., "No face detected", "Image quality too low")
3. WHEN website fetching fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other sites and inform the user of partial results
4. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry functionality
5. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress updates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure similarity thresholds, so that I can fine-tune the matching accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the similarity threshold SHALL be adjustable between 0.1 and 1.0
2. WHEN the threshold is set THEN the system SHALL use this value to filter matching results
3. WHEN the threshold is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new value to subsequent searches
4. IF no threshold is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 0.7
5. WHEN an invalid threshold is provided THEN the system SHALL use the default value and log a warning
