# Testing Guidelines

## Important: No Early Test Creation

**DO NOT create or run tests before task 18 in any spec execution.**

Task 18 is specifically dedicated to adding comprehensive tests to the application. Creating tests earlier disrupts the development workflow and creates unnecessary overhead.

## When Tests Should Be Created

- Only after task 18 is reached in the implementation plan
- Tests should be comprehensive and cover all implemented functionality
- Follow the testing patterns established in the existing codebase

## What to Focus On Instead

- Implement core functionality first
- Ensure code quality and security
- Follow the established architecture patterns
- Complete all implementation tasks before testing

This guideline applies to all spec executions and task implementations to maintain consistent development workflow.
