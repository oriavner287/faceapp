# Security Configuration

## Current CORS Policy

**Status**: Development/Testing Phase - Permissive CORS

Currently, the backend allows all origins (`*`) in production to facilitate development and testing with temporary frontend URLs.

### Current Configuration:

- **Development**: Specific localhost origins only
- **Production**: All origins allowed (`*`)

## Future Security Implementation

### Phase 1: Authentication-Based Authorization (Planned)

Instead of relying on CORS for security, we will implement:

1. **User Authentication**

   - JWT tokens or session-based authentication
   - User registration and login system
   - Secure token storage and validation

2. **API Authorization**

   - All API endpoints will require valid authentication
   - Token validation middleware on protected routes
   - Role-based access control if needed

3. **CORS Refinement**
   - Once frontend domains are stable, restrict CORS to specific domains
   - Maintain authentication as primary security layer

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Future)

- Rate limiting per user/IP
- API key management for different access levels
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement

## Why This Approach?

1. **Flexibility**: Allows testing from various temporary URLs (Vercel previews, etc.)
2. **Security**: Authentication provides better security than CORS alone
3. **Scalability**: Token-based auth scales better than domain restrictions
4. **User Experience**: Proper auth flow provides better UX than CORS errors

## Implementation Timeline

- [x] **Current**: Permissive CORS for development
- [ ] **Next**: Implement user authentication system
- [ ] **Then**: Add API authorization middleware
- [ ] **Finally**: Restrict CORS to known domains

## Notes

- CORS is not a security feature - it's a browser policy
- Real security comes from proper authentication and authorization
- This approach prioritizes development velocity while planning for proper security
